### Key Decisions Made

1. **Auto-save enabled** - Files save after 1 second (Replit-like behavior)
2. **Live preview in VS Code** - Using Simple Browser + Live Preview extension
3. **Tailwind auto-sorting** - Classes automatically sorted on save (Headwind)
4. **Project-specific snippets** - Created 17+ custom snippets for this project's patterns
5. **Multi-tenancy enforcement** - All database snippets include `customerId` check
6. **Path aliases configured** - Using `@/`, `@shared/`, `@assets/` for imports
7. **Double quotes preference** - Set for consistency across project

### Technical Details

**Total Extensions**: 35+
**Code Snippets**: 25+
**Keyboard Shortcuts**: 15+
**Documentation Pages**: 3 (970 lines total)
**Git Commits**: 6
**Files Modified/Created**: 15

### Configuration Files

All stored in `.vscode/`:
- `settings.json` - Editor and tool settings (175 lines)
- `extensions.json` - Recommended extensions (136 lines)
- `tasks.json` - Quick tasks (127 lines)
- `launch.json` - Debug configurations (82 lines)

Cmd+'              # Toggle terminal
```

**Common Workflows**:
1. Type snippet prefix → Press Tab
2. Edit Tailwind classes → See color swatches
3. Save → Auto-sorts classes, formats code
4. Preview updates instantly

**For Claude Code**:
- All patterns documented in `.claude/CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Next Steps

Recommended follow-up tasks:
1. Install recommended extensions when prompted
2. Reload VS Code to activate new settings
3. Test snippets in actual development
4. Customize keybindings if needed
5. Add any project-specific snippets as needed

### Notes for Future Sessions

- All documentation is in `.claude/` directory
- CLAUDE.md contains project overview (not session history)
- This file (SESSION_HISTORY.md) tracks conversations
- VS Code config is version controlled on `railway-deployment` branch
- All 6 commits pushed to GitHub

### Questions Answered

**Q**: "Can I edit UI elements in the preview extension?"
**A**: No, the preview is for viewing only. Workflow is: Claude writes code → You see it in preview → Tell Claude adjustments → Repeat.

**Q**: "What is remote?"
**A**: Remote = Your code on GitHub (backup/collaboration). Local = Your code on your computer.

**Q**: "Are these the best UI editing tools for working with Claude Code on UI?"
**A**: Yes, optimized for this specific project with Express, React, Drizzle, OpenAI, etc.

**Q**: "Should we create a document that can be saved in the Claude file?"
**A**: Yes! Created comprehensive documentation in `.claude/` directory.
