## Session: October 21, 2025 - Database Configuration Simplification & Live Preview Setup

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Branch**: `railway-deployment`
**Goal**: Simplify database configuration, fix development environment setup, and guide user through live preview workflow

### What Was Accomplished

#### 1. Database Configuration Simplification
- ✅ Reduced database config from 483 lines to ~140 lines (70% reduction)
- ✅ Eliminated complex environment-specific database URL logic
- ✅ Unified all environments to use single `DATABASE_URL` (Neon PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Simplified environment detection to use `APP_ENVIRONMENT` (development, production, *-demo)
- ✅ Removed legacy Replit-specific code and references
- ✅ Added backwards compatibility for existing function calls (`isDemo` alias)

**Files Modified**:
- `server/config/database.ts` - Complete rewrite (483 → 137 lines)
- `server/storage.ts` - Updated to use `isDemoEnvironment` instead of `isDemo`
- `.env` - Updated with correct environment variables

#### 2. Development Environment Fixes
- ✅ Fixed port conflict: Changed from 5000 to 5001 (macOS ControlCenter conflict)
- ✅ Updated Vite proxy to point to port 5001
- ✅ Fixed `.env` loading with tsx `--env-file` flag
- ✅ Updated VS Code keybinding for preview (Cmd+K Cmd+P) to use port 5001
- ✅ Fixed database connection logging ("Replit" → "Neon")

**Files Modified**:
- `.env` - Added `PORT=5001`
- `vite.config.ts` - Updated proxy target to localhost:5001
- `package.json` - Changed dev script to use `tsx --env-file=.env`
- `.vscode/keybindings.json` - Updated preview URL to port 5001

#### 3. Login & Security Middleware Fixes
- ✅ Fixed security middleware blocking login in development mode
- ✅ Added `isDemo` field to `getDatabaseConnectionInfo()` for backwards compatibility
- ✅ Verified user credentials in database (username: Pippa, password: 77Emily#77)
- ✅ Tested password hash validation with bcrypt

#### 4. Live Preview Workflow Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive guide for using live preview environment
- ✅ Explained chat-to-code workflow (describe → code → auto-refresh)
- ✅ Demonstrated live editing with background color change (blue → green → blue)
- ✅ Explained environment detection limitations (can't see user's screen)
- ✅ Provided multiple methods for opening preview in VS Code

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Single Database for All Environments**
   - **Decision**: Use one Neon database URL for development, production, and demo modes
   - **Rationale**: Eliminates complexity, reduces configuration errors, matches actual usage
   - **Impact**: Dramatically simplified codebase, easier to maintain

2. **APP_ENVIRONMENT vs NODE_ENV**
   - **Decision**: Keep `APP_ENVIRONMENT` for app behavior (demo vs prod), use `NODE_ENV` for build mode
   - **Rationale**: User wanted to distinguish between demo mode (read-only) and production (full access)
   - **Options**: development, production, post-secondary-demo, k12-demo, tutoring-demo

3. **Port Change to 5001**
   - **Decision**: Change from 5000 to 5001
   - **Rationale**: macOS ControlCenter uses port 5000, causing conflicts
   - **Impact**: Requires updating all references to localhost:5000

4. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - **Decision**: Add `isDemo` alias for `isDemoEnvironment`
   - **Rationale**: Existing code in routes.ts expects `isDemo` field
   - **Impact**: No breaking changes to existing security middleware

### Code Changes

**Files Modified** (11):
- `server/config/database.ts` - Complete rewrite
- `server/storage.ts` - Fixed field name (`isDemo` → `isDemoEnvironment`)
- `.env` - Updated environment variables
- `vite.config.ts` - Updated proxy port
- `package.json` - Updated dev script
- `.vscode/keybindings.json` - Updated preview URL
- `client/src/pages/Index.tsx` - Demonstrated live editing (blue → green → blue)

**Configuration Changes**:
- Database: All environments now use Neon PostgreSQL
- Port: Backend moved from 5000 → 5001
- Environment loading: Using tsx --env-file flag

### Technical Details

**Database Configuration (Before vs After)**:

Before:
- 483 lines of complex environment logic
- 12+ environment configurations (all pointing to same DB)
- Complex security validation
- Replit-specific references

After:
- 137 lines of simplified code
- Single DATABASE_URL for all environments
- Simple demo mode detection (APP_ENVIRONMENT contains 'demo')
- Clean Neon PostgreSQL references

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:...@ep-dark-breeze-aezh6e7z.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
APP_ENVIRONMENT=development  # or production, post-secondary-demo, etc.
NODE_ENV=development         # or production
PORT=5001
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
SESSION_SECRET=local-dev-secret-change-in-production
```

### Questions Answered

**Q**: "We should be using the Neon database?"
**A**: Yes! You're already using Neon database via Railway. All environment configurations pointed to the same Neon DB, so we simplified it to use one DATABASE_URL.

**Q**: "Should we eliminate the distinction between dev, demo, and prod servers?"
**A**: Partially yes - all use the same Neon database, but we kept APP_ENVIRONMENT to distinguish between demo mode (read-only for presentations) and production (full access for editing prompts).

**Q**: "Can you tell what view I am looking at?"
**A**: No, Claude Code cannot see your browser or screen. You need to tell me the URL, describe what you see, or tell me what you want to edit.

**Q**: "How do I use preview to edit?"
**A**: The workflow is: (1) Tell Claude what you want to change, (2) Claude edits the code, (3) Browser auto-refreshes to show changes. It's chat-driven editing, not click-to-edit.

**Q**: "How do I open preview in VS Code?"
**A**: Use Cmd+K Cmd+P (after reloading VS Code), or press F1 and type "Simple Browser: Show", then enter http://localhost:5001.

### Workflow Demonstrated

1. **Live Editing Example**:
   - User: "Make the background green not blue"
   - Claude: Found `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-600 to-blue-800` in Index.tsx
   - Claude: Changed to `from-green-600 to-green-800`
   - Result: Browser auto-refreshed with green background
   - User: "Undo the green background change"
   - Claude: Reverted to blue
   - Result: Browser auto-refreshed back to blue

2. **Environment Switching**:
   - Explained how to switch environments using browser console
   - Provided localStorage commands to switch to demo mode
   - Noted that environment switcher should be visible in nav bar

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Login Security Violation**:
   - Issue: Security middleware blocked login in development mode
   - Cause: `getDatabaseConnectionInfo()` returned `isDemoEnvironment` but code expected `isDemo`
   - Solution: Added `isDemo` alias field for backwards compatibility

2. **Port Conflict**:
   - Issue: macOS ControlCenter occupied port 5000
   - Attempted: Killing process (didn't work - system process)
   - Solution: Changed app to use port 5001

3. **Server Not Restarting**:
   - Issue: Code changes not taking effect
   - Cause: tsx doesn't auto-restart on config changes
   - Solution: Manual restart of dev server

4. **Environment Variable Loading**:
   - Issue: .env file not being loaded by tsx
   - Solution: Changed npm script to use `tsx --env-file=.env`

### Next Steps

**Immediate**:
- [ ] User needs to restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] User should test login with credentials (Pippa / 77Emily#77)
- [ ] User should verify live preview works correctly

**Future Improvements**:
- [ ] Consider adding nodemon for auto-restart on server changes
- [ ] Add better error messages for environment configuration
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new simplified database setup
- [ ] Consider removing unused environment detection code
- [ ] Add integration tests for environment switching

**Documentation Updates Needed**:
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with simplified database configuration
- [ ] Document the port change (5000 → 5001)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common setup issues
- [ ] Update Quick Reference with new environment variables

### Notes for Future Sessions

- Database configuration is now dramatically simpler (137 lines vs 483)
- All environments use single Neon database URL
- Port 5001 is now the default (avoid macOS conflicts)
- Live preview workflow is chat-driven, not click-to-edit
- Environment switching works via localStorage or nav dropdown
- User successfully logged in as Pippa (demo-customer)
