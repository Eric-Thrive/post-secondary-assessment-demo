# Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive rate limiting middleware for the email-verified registration system to protect against abuse and ensure system stability.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Middleware (`apps/server/middleware/rate-limit.ts`)

Created a flexible, reusable rate limiting middleware with the following features:

- **Configurable limits**: Customizable request limits and time windows
- **Multiple key strategies**: IP-based and email-based rate limiting
- **Standard headers**: RFC 6585 compliant rate limit headers
- **Retry information**: Includes retry-after information in responses
- **Automatic cleanup**: Expired entries are automatically removed

### 2. Pre-configured Rate Limiters

Implemented four pre-configured rate limiters matching the requirements:

| Limiter              | Endpoint                        | Limit | Window | Strategy    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| `registration`       | `/api/auth/register`            | 5     | 1 hour | IP-based    |
| `resendVerification` | `/api/auth/resend-verification` | 3     | 1 hour | Email-based |
| `support`            | `/api/support/request`          | 10    | 1 hour | IP-based    |
| `sales`              | `/api/sales/inquiry`            | 10    | 1 hour | IP-based    |

### 3. Integration

#### Auth Routes (`apps/server/routes/auth-routes.ts`)

- Added rate limiting to registration endpoint (5 per hour per IP)
- Added rate limiting to resend verification endpoint (3 per hour per email)

#### Support/Sales Routes (`apps/server/routes/support-sales-routes.ts`)

- Refactored to use centralized rate limiting middleware
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing tests
- Removed duplicate rate limiting code

### 4. Response Headers

All rate-limited endpoints now return:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: ISO 8601 timestamp of reset time
- `Retry-After`: Seconds until reset (when limit exceeded)

### 5. Error Responses

When rate limit is exceeded, returns 429 status with:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "Custom error message for the endpoint",
  "retryAfter": 3600,
  "resetTime": "2025-10-30T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`apps/server/__tests__/unit/rate-limit.test.ts`)

Created comprehensive unit tests covering:

- Basic rate limiting functionality
- Request blocking when limit exceeded
- Retry-after header inclusion
- Custom key generators
- Custom error messages
- Pre-configured limiters
- Rate limit headers
- Email-based vs IP-based limiting

**Test Results**: 15 tests, all passing ✅

### Integration Tests

Verified existing integration tests still pass:

- Support request rate limiting
- Sales inquiry rate limiting
- All validation and error handling

**Test Results**: 13 tests, all passing ✅

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `apps/server/middleware/rate-limit.ts` - Core rate limiting middleware
- `apps/server/__tests__/unit/rate-limit.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `apps/server/middleware/README.md` - Documentation

### Modified

- `apps/server/routes/auth-routes.ts` - Added rate limiting to auth endpoints
- `apps/server/routes/support-sales-routes.ts` - Refactored to use centralized middleware

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 10.4**: Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse

- Registration endpoint: 5 requests per hour per IP
- Resend verification: 3 requests per hour per email
- Support/sales endpoints: 10 requests per hour per IP
- Rate limit headers included in all responses
- Appropriate error messages when limits exceeded

## Security Considerations

1. **IP-based limiting**: Protects against automated attacks from single sources
2. **Email-based limiting**: Prevents email flooding for verification resends
3. **Automatic cleanup**: Prevents memory leaks from expired entries
4. **Configurable limits**: Easy to adjust based on traffic patterns
5. **Standard compliance**: Follows RFC 6585 for rate limit headers

## Production Notes

Current implementation uses in-memory storage suitable for:

- Single-server deployments
- Development and testing environments
- Low to moderate traffic volumes

For production with multiple servers, consider:

- Redis-based distributed rate limiting
- Database-backed storage
- Third-party rate limiting services

## Next Steps

The rate limiting middleware is complete and ready for use. Future enhancements could include:

1. Redis integration for distributed rate limiting
2. Per-user rate limits (in addition to IP-based)
3. Dynamic rate limit adjustment based on system load
4. Rate limit monitoring and alerting
5. Whitelist/blacklist functionality
