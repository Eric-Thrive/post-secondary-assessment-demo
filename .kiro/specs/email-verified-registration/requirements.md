# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines an email-verified user registration system with administrative notifications for the AI-powered educational accessibility platform. The system implements a secure registration flow where new users must verify their email addresses before gaining platform access. Additionally, it establishes an automated notification system that alerts system administrators when users register, request support, or inquire about sales. This ensures proper user onboarding security while enabling timely administrative response to user needs.
