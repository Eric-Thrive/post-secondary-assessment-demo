# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing the K-12 Tutor Guide interface with visual styling adapted from the post-secondary accommodation report design specification. The K-12 Report Viewer will maintain its existing section structure (Case Information, Documents Reviewed, Student Overview, Key Support Strategies, Student's Strengths, Student's Challenges) while applying the design patterns, component styles, and visual treatments from the post-secondary report to create a cohesive, professional interface that aligns with the established design system.

## Glossary

- **K-12 Report Viewer**: The user interface component that displays student tutor guide reports for K-12 educational contexts
- **Tutor Guide Report**: A comprehensive document containing case information, document reviews, student overview, support strategies, strengths, and challenges
- **Navigation Panel**: The left-side component that displays the report's table of contents and section structure
- **Content Area**: The main viewing area where report sections and content are displayed
- **Section Card**: An expandable component displaying section content with consistent styling
- **User**: An educator, tutor, administrator, or support staff member viewing the report
- **Design System**: The shared UI components, patterns, colors, and typography defined in the post-secondary report design specification
- **Sunwashed Palette**: The K-12 brand color scheme (Navy Blue #1297D2, Sky Blue #96D7E1, Orange #F89E54, Yellow #FDE677)

## Design Reference

This K-12 Report Viewer implementation SHALL apply the visual design patterns from the post-secondary report design specification to the existing K-12 Tutor Guide structure. The baseline design specification is located at:

#[[file:.figma/post-secondary-report-design.md]]

The existing K-12 Figma mockup is located at: `.figma/k12-figma-design/`

Key design elements to adapt from post-secondary to K-12:

- Card component styling (borders, shadows, spacing, visual hierarchy)
- Typography system (heading hierarchy, font weights, sizes)
- Layout patterns (consistent spacing, alignment, responsive behavior)
- Interactive component styling (accordions, buttons, hover states)
- Accessibility patterns (focus indicators, ARIA labels, semantic structure)
- Professional visual polish (consistent borders, shadows, color usage)

The K-12 report SHALL maintain its Sunwashed color palette for branding while adopting the post-secondary design system's component patterns and visual refinement.
