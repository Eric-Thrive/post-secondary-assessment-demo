# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a modular, config-driven K-12 Teacher Guide Report Viewer that serves as the foundation for a unified THRIVE report design system. The K-12 Report Viewer will be built using reusable design system components, design tokens, and a configuration-based architecture that enables easy adaptation for other report types (Tutoring Tutor Guides, Post-Secondary Accommodation Reports) without code duplication.

The implementation will maintain the shared section structure used by both K-12 Teacher Guides and Tutoring Tutor Guides (Case Information, Documents Reviewed, Student Overview, Key Support Strategies, Student's Strengths, Student's Challenges) while establishing a modular component library that can be reused across all THRIVE report types. This approach addresses the maintainability issues present in the current post-secondary report implementation by eliminating inline styles, centralizing design tokens, and creating pluggable section components.

## Glossary

- **K-12 Report Viewer**: The user interface component that displays Teacher Guide reports for K-12 educational contexts
- **Teacher Guide Report**: A comprehensive document for K-12 contexts containing case information, document reviews, student overview, support strategies, strengths, and challenges
- **Tutor Guide Report**: A comprehensive document for tutoring contexts with the same structure as Teacher Guides but tailored for one-on-one tutoring sessions
- **Design System**: A collection of reusable components, design tokens, and patterns that ensure visual consistency across all THRIVE report types
- **Design Tokens**: Centralized variables for colors, spacing, typography, shadows, and other design values that can be referenced throughout the application
- **Report Configuration**: A data structure that defines sections, branding, and behavior for a specific report type without requiring code changes
- **Modular Component**: A self-contained, reusable UI component that can be composed with other components to build different report types
- **Navigation Panel**: The left-side component that displays the report's table of contents and section structure
- **Content Area**: The main viewing area where report sections and content are displayed
- **Section Component**: A pluggable component that renders specific content for a report section (e.g., CaseInformationContent, DocumentsReviewedContent)
- **Layout Component**: A structural component that provides consistent positioning and styling (e.g., ThriveReportLayout, ThriveReportSidebar)
- **User**: An educator, tutor, administrator, or support staff member viewing the report
- **Sunwashed Palette**: The K-12 brand color scheme (Navy Blue #1297D2, Sky Blue #96D7E1, Orange #F89E54, Yellow #FDE677)

## Design Reference

This K-12 Report Viewer implementation SHALL apply the visual design patterns from the post-secondary report design specification to the existing K-12 Teacher Guide structure. The baseline design specification is located at:

#[[file:.figma/post-secondary-report-design.md]]

The existing K-12 Figma mockup is located at: `.figma/k12-figma-design/`

Key design elements to adapt from post-secondary to K-12:

- Card component styling (borders, shadows, spacing, visual hierarchy)
- Typography system (heading hierarchy, font weights, sizes)
- Layout patterns (consistent spacing, alignment, responsive behavior)
- Interactive component styling (accordions, buttons, hover states)
- Accessibility patterns (focus indicators, ARIA labels, semantic structure)
- Professional visual polish (consistent borders, shadows, color usage)

The K-12 report SHALL maintain its Sunwashed color palette for branding while adopting the post-secondary design system's component patterns and visual refinement.
