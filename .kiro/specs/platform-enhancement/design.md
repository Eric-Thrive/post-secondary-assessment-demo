# Platform Enhancement Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for enhancing the AI-powered educational accessibility platform. The platform will be upgraded with comprehensive testing infrastructure, legacy code cleanup (post-Replit migration), performance monitoring, enhanced user experience, security improvements with FERPA and HIPAA compliance preparation, and multi-environment deployment with pathway selection capabilities.

The design focuses on maintaining the existing three-module architecture (K-12, Post-Secondary, Tutoring) while adding robust infrastructure, testing, and operational capabilities to support enterprise-scale deployment. A key architectural decision is the implementation of Simple Analysis Pathway across all environments (development, demo, production) for all three modules, with Complex Analysis Pathway available only in development environment for testing and advanced feature development.

### Environment Architecture

The platform will support three distinct environments with different pathway configurations across all three modules (K-12, Post-Secondary, Tutoring):

- **Development Environment**: Full access to both Simple and Complex Analysis Pathways for all modules with pathway selection capability
- **Demo Environment**: Simple Analysis Pathway only for all modules with sample data
- **Production Environment**: Simple Analysis Pathway only for all modules with real user data

**Design Rationale**: This architecture ensures production stability by limiting complex processing to development environments while providing consistent Simple Analysis functionality across all deployment targets. The restriction of Complex Analysis Pathway to development environment allows for safe testing and feature development without impacting production performance or reliability.

## Pathway Deployment Strategy

### Simple Analysis Pathway Deployment

The Simple Analysis Pathway will be deployed across all environments for all three modules (K-12, Post-Secondary, Tutoring) with the following characteristics:

**Development Environment**:
