# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the next stage of development for the AI-powered educational accessibility platform. The platform currently supports K-12, Post-Secondary, and Tutoring modules with comprehensive AI-driven assessment report generation. The next development phase focuses on deploying the simple analysis pathway across all environments (development, demo, production) for each module, while enhancing platform scalability, user experience, testing infrastructure, and production readiness. The complex analysis pathway will be available only in production mode as an advanced option.
