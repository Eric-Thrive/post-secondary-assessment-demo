# Report Review & Commenting System - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive asynchronous report review and commenting system that enables AI-generated review comments, human-initiated edits, track changes workflow, and team-based approval processes. The system extends the existing report versioning infrastructure to support collaborative review without requiring real-time synchronization.

The system addresses the need for quality assurance in educational assessment reports through structured review workflows, automated AI quality checks, and human oversight with full audit trails.

## Glossary

- **Review System**: The complete infrastructure for commenting, suggesting changes, and approving reports
- **AI Comment**: Automated comment generated by AI based on confidence scores and quality rules
- **Human Comment**: Comment added by a human reviewer on any report section
- **Suggestion**: A tracked change (insert, delete, replace) proposed by a reviewer
- **Track Changes**: Visual system showing proposed edits similar to Microsoft Word
- **Review Stage**: Current workflow state (draft, ai_review, peer_review, final_review, approved)
- **Comment Thread**: A comment and all its replies, grouped by threadId
- **Anchor**: The specific location in a report where a comment applies (section, paragraph, line)
- **Assessment Case**: The parent entity containing report data and review information
- **Customer Isolation**: Multi-tenancy enforcement ensuring users only see their organization's data
- **Finalized Version**: Immutable snapshot of approved report content stored in version history
- **Audit Trail**: Complete chronological record of all review actions, edits, and decisions
- **Edit History**: Detailed log of content changes including original text, modifications, and change rationale
- **Module Type**: Assessment category (k12, post_secondary, tutoring) that determines specific AI rules and workflows

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI-Generated Review Comments _(Future Feature)_

**User Story:** As an external AI system, I want to submit pre-generated comments to the review system, so that quality issues identified during report generation can be displayed and managed by human reviewers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an external AI system submits comments via API, THE Review_System SHALL store them with commentType 'ai_review' and authorName 'AI Assistant'

3. THE Review_System SHALL allow human reviewers to resolve AI-generated comments with resolution notes
4. THE Review_System SHALL support priority levels for AI comments (low, medium, high, critical) as specified by the AI system
5. WHERE AI comments are linked to specific report sections, THE Review_System SHALL display them anchored to the appropriate content

**Note**: This requirement represents a future roadmap feature. The review system will be designed to accommodate AI comments but initial implementation focuses on human-generated comments.

### Requirement 2: Human Comment Management

**User Story:** As a human reviewer, I want to add comments to any section of a report, so that I can provide feedback and request clarifications.

5. WHEN a team lead accepts a suggestion, THE Review_System SHALL apply the change to the report content

### Requirement 4: Review Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to manage the review process through defined stages, so that reports progress systematically from draft to approval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Review_System SHALL enforce workflow stages: draft → ai_review → peer_review → final_review → approved

4. THE Review_System SHALL track metrics including total comments, unresolved comments, and pending suggestions
5. WHEN a report is approved, THE Review_System SHALL create a finalized version in the assessment case history

### Requirement 5: Customer Isolation and Security
