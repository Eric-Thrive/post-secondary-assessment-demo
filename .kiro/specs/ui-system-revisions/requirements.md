# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the UI system revisions for the AI-powered educational accessibility platform. The platform currently has inconsistent home screen designs across different environments and modules. This revision focuses on standardizing the home screen experience across all environments (development, demo, production) and all modules (K-12, Post-Secondary, Tutoring) with a clean, modern interface featuring the THRIVE branding and intuitive navigation cards.

## Glossary

- **Assessment_Platform**: The complete AI-powered educational accessibility platform system
- **Home_Screen**: The main landing page users see after authentication across all modules
- **Navigation_Cards**: The primary action buttons/cards for "New Report" and "View Reports" functionality
- **THRIVE_Branding**: The consistent brand identity including logo, colors, and typography
- **Module_System**: The three-module architecture (K-12, Post-Secondary, Tutoring)
- **Environment_System**: The multi-environment deployment architecture (development, demo, production)
- **UI_Framework**: The standardized user interface components and design system
- **Responsive_Design**: The adaptive layout system that works across different screen sizes
- **Brand_Guidelines**: The visual design standards including colors, typography, and spacing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want a consistent and modern home screen design across all modules and environments, so that I have a familiar and professional experience regardless of which module or environment I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access any module home screen, THE Home_Screen SHALL display the THRIVE logo prominently in the header
2. WHEN users view the home screen, THE Home_Screen SHALL present two primary Navigation_Cards for "New Report" and "View Reports" functionality
3. WHEN users access different modules, THE Home_Screen SHALL maintain consistent layout, colors, and typography across K-12, Post-Secondary, and Tutoring modules
4. WHERE users switch between environments, THE Home_Screen SHALL provide identical visual design in development, demo, and production environments
5. WHILE users interact with the interface, THE Home_Screen SHALL maintain responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the "New Report" navigation card to be visually distinct and prominently featured, so that users can easily initiate the primary workflow of creating assessment reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users view the home screen, THE Navigation_Cards SHALL display the "New Report" card with a blue color scheme and plus icon
2. WHEN users hover over the "New Report" card, THE UI_Framework SHALL provide visual feedback with appropriate hover states
3. WHEN users click the "New Report" card, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL navigate to the appropriate report creation workflow for the current module
4. WHERE accessibility is required, THE Navigation_Cards SHALL include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
5. WHILE maintaining brand consistency, THE Navigation_Cards SHALL use the established THRIVE color palette and typography

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the "View Reports" navigation card to provide clear access to existing reports, so that I can easily review and manage previously generated assessment reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users view the home screen, THE Navigation_Cards SHALL display the "View Reports" card with an orange color scheme and document icon
2. WHEN users interact with the "View Reports" card, THE UI_Framework SHALL show the current count of available reports for the user
3. WHEN users click the "View Reports" card, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL navigate to the reports listing page for the current module
4. WHERE no reports exist, THE Navigation_Cards SHALL display appropriate messaging indicating "0 reports available" or similar
5. WHILE displaying report counts, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL update the count dynamically based on user permissions and data access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the home screen components to be reusable and maintainable across all modules, so that we can efficiently manage UI updates and ensure consistency without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the home screen, THE UI_Framework SHALL create reusable components that work across all three modules
2. WHEN module-specific customization is needed, THE UI_Framework SHALL support configuration-based customization without duplicating components
3. WHEN updates are made to the home screen design, THE UI_Framework SHALL propagate changes across all modules automatically
4. WHERE branding elements are used, THE UI_Framework SHALL centralize brand assets and styling for consistent application
5. WHILE maintaining modularity, THE UI_Framework SHALL ensure components are properly typed and documented for developer use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the home screen to load quickly and provide immediate visual feedback, so that I can efficiently navigate to my desired functionality without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users navigate to the home screen, THE Home_Screen SHALL load within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
2. WHEN the page is loading, THE UI_Framework SHALL display appropriate loading states and skeleton screens
3. WHEN interactive elements are ready, THE Navigation_Cards SHALL be immediately clickable without additional loading delays
4. WHERE network conditions are poor, THE Home_Screen SHALL gracefully degrade while maintaining core functionality
5. WHILE optimizing performance, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL implement proper caching strategies for static assets and branding elements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the home screen to maintain consistent branding and visual hierarchy, so that the platform presents a professional and cohesive user experience that aligns with THRIVE brand guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the THRIVE logo, THE Home_Screen SHALL use the correct logo variant, size, and positioning according to brand guidelines
2. WHEN applying colors, THE UI_Framework SHALL use the official THRIVE color palette with proper contrast ratios for accessibility
3. WHEN displaying typography, THE Home_Screen SHALL use consistent font families, sizes, and weights that align with brand standards
4. WHERE spacing and layout are applied, THE UI_Framework SHALL follow established design system spacing and grid principles
5. WHILE maintaining brand consistency, THE Home_Screen SHALL ensure all visual elements meet WCAG accessibility standards

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the home screen navigation to be intuitive and accessible, so that I can easily understand and use the interface regardless of my technical expertise or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users first see the home screen, THE Navigation_Cards SHALL clearly communicate their purpose through icons, labels, and descriptions
2. WHEN users navigate using keyboard only, THE Home_Screen SHALL provide proper tab order and focus indicators
3. WHEN users use screen readers, THE UI_Framework SHALL provide appropriate semantic markup and ARIA labels
4. WHERE users have visual impairments, THE Home_Screen SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast and support high contrast modes
5. WHILE ensuring accessibility, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL provide alternative text for all images and icons
