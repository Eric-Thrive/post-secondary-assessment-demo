# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a unified login and initial dashboard experience for the AI-powered educational accessibility platform. Currently, the login screen displays module-specific branding ("Post-Secondary Portal") which creates confusion for users who may have access to multiple modules or different modules entirely. This redesign creates a module-agnostic authentication flow and initial dashboard that presents users with their available modules and provides a professional, unified entry point to the platform regardless of user role or module access.

## Glossary

- **Assessment_Platform**: The complete AI-powered educational accessibility platform system
- **Unified_Login**: The module-agnostic authentication interface that serves all user types
- **Module_Dashboard**: The initial screen after login showing available modules and user-specific options
- **Module_Card**: Visual components representing each available module (K-12, Post-Secondary, Tutoring)
- **User_Role**: The permission level assigned to each user (Developer, Admin, Org Admin, Customer, Demo)
- **Module_Access**: The specific modules a user has permission to access based on their role and assignments
- **THRIVE_Branding**: The consistent platform brand identity without module-specific messaging
- **Authentication_Flow**: The complete login process from initial screen to module selection
- **Access_Control**: The system that determines which modules and features are available to each user
- **Welcome_Experience**: The personalized greeting and orientation provided to users after authentication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As any platform user, I want a clean, professional login screen that doesn't assume which module I'll be using, so that I feel confident I'm in the right place regardless of my intended module.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the login page, THE Unified_Login SHALL display generic THRIVE branding without module-specific text
2. WHEN users see the login form, THE Unified_Login SHALL use neutral messaging like "Sign in to access your assessment portal" instead of module-specific descriptions
3. WHEN users view the login screen, THE Unified_Login SHALL maintain professional visual design with the THRIVE logo and color scheme
4. WHERE users bookmark the login page, THE Unified_Login SHALL work as a universal entry point for all modules and user types
5. WHILE maintaining brand consistency, THE Unified_Login SHALL remove all references to "Post-Secondary Portal" or other module-specific terminology

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with access to multiple modules, I want to see all my available modules after login, so that I can choose which module to work in without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users with access to multiple modules complete authentication, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL display cards for each module the user has access to
2. WHEN users have Developer or Admin roles, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL show all three modules (K-12, Post-Secondary, Tutoring) as available options
3. WHEN users have Org Admin roles with multiple module assignments, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL display only their assigned modules
4. WHERE users have access to multiple modules, THE Authentication_Flow SHALL always show the Module_Dashboard for selection
5. WHILE displaying modules, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL use distinct visual design for each Module_Card with appropriate icons and descriptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with single module access, I want to be taken directly to my module's home screen after login, so that I can start working immediately without unnecessary navigation steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users with Customer or Demo roles have access to only one module, THE Authentication_Flow SHALL redirect them directly to their assigned module's home screen after login
2. WHEN single-module users complete authentication, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL bypass the Module_Dashboard entirely
3. WHEN single-module users need to understand their access level, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL display module-specific information on their home screen
4. WHERE single-module users want to request additional access, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL provide upgrade or contact options within their module's interface
5. WHILE streamlining the experience, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL maintain consistent branding and navigation patterns within the destination module

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a demo user, I want to understand that I'm in a trial environment and be directed efficiently to my assigned module, so that I can evaluate the platform's capabilities without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demo users with single module access log in, THE Authentication_Flow SHALL redirect them directly to their assigned module's home screen with demo status clearly indicated
2. WHEN demo users with multiple module access log in, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL display available modules with demo-specific messaging and limitations
3. WHEN demo users interact with their assigned module, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL display demo-specific guidance and upgrade prompts where appropriate
4. WHERE demo users explore features, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL provide information about full platform capabilities available after upgrade
5. WHILE in demo mode, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL maintain professional appearance without making the demo experience feel limited or inferior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the unified dashboard to provide administrative access points, so that I can efficiently manage the platform without navigating through module-specific interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users with Developer or Admin roles access the Module_Dashboard, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL display administrative options and quick access links
2. WHEN administrators need system monitoring, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL provide links to admin dashboards and analytics
3. WHEN administrators manage users, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL offer direct access to user management interfaces
4. WHERE system configuration is needed, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL provide appropriate administrative controls based on User_Role permissions
5. WHILE maintaining user experience, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL organize administrative features in a way that doesn't overwhelm non-admin users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user returning to the platform, I want the dashboard to remember my preferences and provide quick access to recent work, so that I can resume my activities efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning users access the Module_Dashboard, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL display recently accessed modules and reports
2. WHEN users have work in progress, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL provide quick access to draft reports and incomplete assessments
3. WHEN users frequently use specific modules, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL prioritize those modules in the interface layout
4. WHERE users have established workflows, THE Assessment_Platform SHALL provide shortcuts to commonly used features
5. WHILE personalizing the experience, THE Module_Dashboard SHALL maintain consistent layout and navigation patterns

### Requirement 7
