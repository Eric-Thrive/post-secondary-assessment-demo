# System Admin Users View - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Created a new view in the system-admin dashboard that displays all users with their roles, modules, and email addresses.

## What Was Built

### 1. New Page Component

**File**: `apps/web/src/pages/SystemAdminUsersPage.tsx`

A comprehensive user directory page featuring:

- **Search functionality**: Filter users by username, email, role, or module
- **Statistics cards**: Display total users, active users, and filtered results
- **User table**: Shows all users with the following columns:
  - ID
  - Username
  - Email
  - Role (with friendly labels)
  - Assigned Modules (with badges)
  - Status (Active/Inactive)
  - Organization ID
- **Export to CSV**: Download user data as CSV file
- **Auto-refresh**: Data refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Manual refresh**: Button to refresh data on demand

### 2. Routing

**File**: `apps/web/src/App.tsx`

Added new route:

- Path: `/admin/all-users`
- Protected route requiring authentication
- Accessible to admin and developer roles

### 3. Navigation

**File**: `apps/web/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`

Added "View All Users" button in the Quick Actions section that navigates to the new page.

## Features

### User-Friendly Labels

- Roles are displayed with friendly names (e.g., "System Admin" instead of "system_admin")
- Modules show readable names (e.g., "K-12" instead of "k12")

### Search & Filter

- Real-time search across username, email, role, and modules
- Shows count of filtered results

### Data Export

- Export filtered user list to CSV
- Includes all relevant user information
- Filename includes current date

### Visual Design

- Clean table layout with hover effects
- Color-coded status badges (green for active, red for inactive)
- Module badges for easy identification
- Responsive design

## API Endpoint Used

The page uses the existing `/api/admin/users` endpoint which returns:

- User list with all relevant fields
- Total user count
- Active user count

## Access Control

The page is protected and only accessible to users with:

- `admin` role
- `developer` role
- `system_admin` role
- `org_admin` role (will see only their organization's users)

## How to Access

1. Log in as an admin or developer
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "View All Users" button in Quick Actions
4. Or directly visit: `/admin/all-users`

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Sorting by column headers
- Pagination for large user lists
- Bulk actions (activate/deactivate multiple users)
- Advanced filters (by role, module, status)
- User detail modal with edit capabilities
