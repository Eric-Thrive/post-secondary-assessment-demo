# THRIVE Home Screen Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented the standardized THRIVE home screen design across all modules as requested. The new home screen matches the design shown in the provided image and meets all the requirements from the UI system specifications.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. THRIVE Branding

- **Logo**: Created a custom THRIVE logo component with orange circular design and connection lines
- **Typography**: Large, bold "THRIVE" text using consistent brand styling
- **Colors**: Implemented the THRIVE color palette (blue and orange)

### 2. Navigation Cards

- **New Report Card**: Blue gradient card with plus icon for starting new assessments
- **View Reports Card**: Orange gradient card with document icon for viewing existing reports
- **Interactive Design**: Hover effects, scaling animations, and smooth transitions
- **Responsive Layout**: Cards adapt to different screen sizes

### 3. Admin-Only Features

- **Environment Switcher**: Only visible to users with `system_admin` role
- **Conditional Rendering**: Uses `user?.role === 'system_admin'` check

### 4. User Interface Elements

- **User Info**: Username display and logout button in top-right corner
- **Report Count**: Dynamic count of available reports in the View Reports card
- **Dropdown Menu**: Reports dropdown with individual report listings and "View All" option

### 5. Module Compatibility

- **Universal Design**: Works across K-12, Post-Secondary, and Tutoring modules
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically routes to correct module-specific pages
- **Context Awareness**: Uses ModuleContext to determine appropriate navigation paths

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `apps/web/src/components/shared/ThriveHomeScreen.tsx` - Main home screen component
- `apps/web/src/components/shared/__tests__/ThriveHomeScreen.test.tsx` - Test file

### Modified Files

- `apps/web/src/pages/WelcomeDashboard.tsx` - Updated to use new ThriveHomeScreen
- `apps/web/src/pages/DemoLandingPage.tsx` - Updated navigation after login

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure

```typescript
ThriveHomeScreen
├── ThriveLogo (custom logo component)
├── Header (logo + user info + environment switcher)
├── Navigation Cards
│   ├── New Report Card (blue)
│   └── View Reports Card (orange with dropdown)
└── Responsive Container
```

### Key Features

- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with proper interfaces
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Memoized calculations and efficient re-renders
- **Testing**: Test IDs for automated testing
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design

### Routing Logic

- **New Report**: Routes to module-specific assessment pages
- **View Reports**: Shows dropdown with individual reports + "View All" option
- **Module Detection**: Uses `activeModule` context to determine correct routes

## Design Compliance

✅ **THRIVE Logo**: Prominently displayed in header  
✅ **Blue New Report Card**: Matches design with plus icon  
✅ **Orange View Reports Card**: Matches design with document icon  
✅ **Admin Environment Switcher**: Only visible to system admins  
✅ **User Info**: Username and logout in top-right  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes  
✅ **Consistent Branding**: Uses THRIVE color palette  
✅ **Module Compatibility**: Works across all three modules

## Usage

The new home screen is automatically used when users log in to any module:

1. **Demo Environments**: Users see the THRIVE home screen after logging in via demo landing pages
2. **Development**: Developers see the home screen when accessing the root route
3. **All Modules**: K-12, Post-Secondary, and Tutoring all use the same standardized design

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The home screen will now provide a consistent, professional experience across all environments and modules, matching the THRIVE brand guidelines and user experience requirements.
