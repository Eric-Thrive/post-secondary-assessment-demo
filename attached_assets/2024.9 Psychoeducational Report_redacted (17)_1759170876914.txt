Psychoeducational EvaluationName:[NAME] McWhorterSchool:Brackett Elementary SchoolDate of Birth:12/21/2016Current Grade:2ndAge at Testing:7 years, 8 monthsExaminer:Lauren MahoneyEvaluation Date:8/21/2024Language(s):EnglishREFERRAL INFORMATION[NAME] was referred for this initial evaluation by her parents due to concerns regarding her readingdevelopment given the family history of dyslexia and her performance on progress monitoring measureshighlighting reduced letter fluency. [NAME] has received reading intervention throughout first grade.Parents have also reported challenges with attention regulation and sensory integration amid a familyhistory of ADHD. This evaluation aims to identify any applicable disability categories within the MAspecial education frameworks, assist the TEAM in considering [NAME]igibility for special educationservices, and support her school based TEAM in making appropriate educational decisions.ASSESSMENT PROCEDURESBehavior Assessment Scale for Children, Third Edition (BASC-3)Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second Edition (BRIEF-2)California Verbal Learning Test, Children’s Version (CVLT-C)Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing, Second Edition (CTOPP-2)Gray Oral Reading Test, Fifth Edition (GORT-4)Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement, Third Edition (KTEA-3)Test of Word Reading Efficiency, Second Edition (TOWRE-2)Wechsler Individual Achievement Scale, Fourth Edition (WIAT-4)Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition ([ADDRESS]V)ASSESSMENT FINDINGSBackground InformationBackground information was compiled through a review of records – including school records andtranscripts. Relevant background information regarding current concerns and academic progress ispresented here. For a more extensive developmental and educational history, the reader is encouraged torefer to [NAME]ucational record.[NAME] is a bright and imaginative 7-year-old currently enrolled in the second grade at the [SCHOOL] in [ADDRESS] MA. She has a strong creative streak and enjoys building projects,particularly when collaborating with others. [NAME] deeply values her close relationships with friendsand family and demonstrates kindness, inclusivity, and encouragement toward her peers. She is motivatedto do well in school and strives to achieve her best. Her first-grade teacher, [TEACHER_NAME] reported thatshe displayed excellent self-regulation in emotional, behavioral, and organizational areas, with nosignificant concerns regarding anxiety or attention within the context of her classroom. Additionally,

[NAME] possesses effective coping strategies that help her manage any moments of overwhelm whenthey do occur.During her kindergarten year, [NAME]rformance on the RAN/RAS speeded naming assessmentsplaced her in the 25th percentile, which is within the average range. However, by Fall 2023, DIBELSprogress monitoring measures indicated a need for reading intervention, with particular difficultyregarding reduced letter naming facility. [NAME] worked closely with a reading specialist several timesper week and demonstrated steady progress in reading, although her overall growth was considered belowaverage for the academic year. Given her performance and a family history of dyslexia, [NAME] wasreferred for a comprehensive evaluation for special education by her parents.Upon her return to school in the Fall of 2024, there was evidence of some regression in her reading skills,although MAZE comprehension progress monitoring data was not yet available at the time of this report.At home, [PARENT_NAME]E]'s parents have expressed concerns regarding her anxiety, attention, and sensorysensitivities. They noted that she has a limited diet and often feels overwhelmed by the smells and[NAME] McWhorterDOB: 12/21/2016-2-

presence of certain foods. Her parents are particularly worried about her sensory integration and anxiety,which sometimes make it difficult for her to navigate peer interactions and unfamiliar situations. Inresponse to these concerns, [NAME] has been participating in a weekly group with the school-basedsocial worker since kindergarten, with a focus on managing her anxiety.[PARENT_NAME] lives with her parents and older brother, [PARENT_NAME] who attends the [PARENT_NAME] in Waltham,MA, within the [SCHOOL] District. During a clinical interview, [NAME] shared that sheenjoys playing with Legos, drawing, and spending time with friends. She expressed contentment with hercurrent social circle, noting that while she has enough friends, she is open to making new ones this year.[NAME] reflected positively on her first-grade experience and is looking forward to the upcoming year insecond grade. When asked about her future aspirations or what she would like to be good at by fifthgrade, [NAME] struggled to identify specific goals or interests, even when provided with prompts andchoices. This is not uncommon among lower elementary school students.Behavioral Observations in TestingTesting took place in a single session during summer hours. [NAME] was pleasant, hard-working, anddemonstrated a strong willingness to engage with the tasks presented to her. She presented with greatstamina although required a significant amount of processing time in order to complete all tasks that wereadministered to her. [NAME]rformance in testing is likely representative of her current functioning.Test Results and AnalysisCognitive AssessmentOverall Cognitive Functioning[NAME]neral cognitive abilities were assessed through the use of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale forChildren, Fifth Edition ([ADDRESS]V). The [ADDRESS]V is a standardized, norm-referenced assessment that isadministered in a one-on-one setting and used as a clinical instrument for children aged six years old tochildren aged sixteen years, eleven months. Several factors that are not measured by this or otherintelligence tests include motivation, curiosity, creative talent, work habits, study skills, and achievementin particular academic subjects. These scores should be perceived as one source of information and mustbe interpreted with respect to the child’s complete clinical profile [e.g. social, educational, personalbackground].It is possible for intellectual abilities to change over the course of childhood. Additionally, a child's scoreson the [ADDRESS]V can be influenced by motivation, attention, interests, and opportunities for learning. Allscores may be slightly higher or lower if [NAME] were tested again on a different day. It is thereforeimportant to view these test scores as a snapshot of [NAME]rrent level of intellectual functioning.When these scores are used as part of a comprehensive evaluation, they contribute to an understanding ofher current strengths and any needs that can be addressed.The [ADDRESS]V yields a measure of a child’s general intellectual functioning through the Full-Scale IQ scoreas well as five additional composite scores, which represent a child’s functioning in more discretecognitive domains. [NAME]erall Full Scale IQ score fell at the 75th percentile, which is consideredhigh average.Language DevelopmentThe Verbal Comprehension Index on the [ADDRESS]V measures children’s verbal knowledge, retrieval ofverbal information, and ability to reason with language-based concepts. Specifically, this score reflects[NAME]ility to verbalize meaningful concepts, think about verbal information, and express herself[NAME] McWhorterDOB: 12/21/2016-3-

using words. Overall, [NAME]rformance on the VCI was within the average range, at the 58thpercentile.Nonverbal Reasoning and Visual-Motor IntegrationThe Fluid Reasoning Index on the [ADDRESS]V measures children’s ability to recognize underlyingconceptual relationships among visually presented items and use reasoning to apply logical patterns orrules without employing language. Identification and application of conceptual relationships in the FRIrequire inductive and quantitative reasoning, broad visual intelligence, simultaneous processing, andabstract thinking. Her performance fell within the very high range, at the 92nd percentile.The Visual-Spatial Index on the [ADDRESS]V measured [NAME]ility to evaluate visual details andunderstand visual-spatial relationships in order to construct geometric designs from a model. This skillrequires visual-spatial reasoning, integration and synthesis of part-whole relationships, attentiveness tovisual detail, and visual-motor integration. Her performance fell within the high average range, at the77th percentile.Cognitive Proficiency including Memory, Speed of Processing, and Executive FunctionCognitive proficiency is the estimate of the efficiency with which information is processed in the serviceof learning, problem-solving, and higher-order reasoning. It can demonstrate the efficiency with which[NAME] is processing information and incorporates aspects of attention, memory, executive functioning,and speed of processing.The Working Memory Index from the [ADDRESS]V measured [NAME]ility to register, maintain, andmanipulate visual and auditory information in conscious awareness, which requires attention andconcentration, as well as visual and auditory discrimination. [NAME]rformance fell within the highaverage range, at the 75th percentile.[NAME] presented with below-average performance on the long-delay free recall task of the CaliforniaVerbal Learning Test, Children's Version (CVLT-C). Her difficulties may be linked to challenges withverbal learning and memory, which are often seen in children with developmental verbal learningdisabilities.An error analysis of her performance suggests she may not always utilize effective learning strategies,such as organizing words into meaningful categories, even if this information has already been providedto her. Instead, she may rely on less efficient strategies, such as recalling words in a more random or serialorder. This inefficiency likely contributes to her struggles with recalling information, as organizing wordssemantically allows for better encoding and retrieval. The additional demand of grouping words bymeaning may exceed her language processing capacity. This reinforces that [NAME]rbal capabilitiesare likely strained when required to handle tasks with increased linguistic complexity, leading to poorerrecall performance overall.The Processing Speed Index from the [ADDRESS]V measured [NAME]eed and accuracy of visualidentification, decision making, and decision implementation. Performance on the PSI is related to visualscanning, visual discrimination, short-term visual memory, visuomotor coordination, and concentration.Her overall processing speed performance fell within the low average range, at the 18th percentile.To assess aspects of executive functioning, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning,Second Edition (BRIEF-2) was administered to [PARENT_NAME]E]’s teacher and grandmother. Weaknesses inmemory skills and processing speed may impact additional skills involved in executive functioning,[NAME] McWhorterDOB: 12/21/2016-4-

including metacognition, self-regulation, planning, organization, and the ability to attend to multiplestimuli.Based on teacher responses, [TEACHER_NAME]ME]’s first grade teacher, [TEACHER_NAME] reports that [TEACHER_NAME] shows agood ability to manage her behavior, such as resisting impulses and being aware of how she acts in socialsituations. She adapts well to changes in her surroundings, new people, different plans, or new demands,and she responds appropriately to events. In terms of thinking and learning, [NAME] is able to start tasksor activities, work through problems, and remember things well enough to stay on track. She plans andorganizes her work effectively, checks for mistakes when needed, and keeps her materials and belongingsfairly organized given her age. No current concern for executive functioning, emotional, or behavioralregulation were reported.[PARENT_NAME]E]’s parents also completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-2).While some areas, like her ability to get started on tasks, stay organized, and monitor her work, are notseen as problematic, there are concerns about her emotional control and ability to adapt to changes. Theseresults suggest that [NAME] may have difficulty staying calm and managing her emotions, especiallywhen her routine is disrupted or when flexibility is needed. Children with this pattern often struggle whenthey are asked to adjust their plans or expectations, leading to emotional outbursts or frustration.Additionally, subtle difficulty with utilizing her working memory and planning/organizing are alsoobserved as areas of concern.Social-Emotional AssessmentEmotional ScreeningThe BASC-3 is an assessment tool that provides a snapshot of behavioral and emotional functioning. Thesurvey assesses a wide array of behaviors that represent both behavioral problems and strengths, includinginternalizing or externalizing problems, issues in school, and adaptive skills.According to [NAME] responses on the BASC-3, [NAME] shows high levels of internal distress,which she expresses through physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches. These symptoms arelikely tied to her emotional state. [NAME]matic symptoms, such as these physical complaints, maybe related to underlying stress/anxiety though these specific scales were not elevated on her BASC-3profile. It is important to explore how these physical symptoms might be connected to her emotionalwell-being. Teacher responses were at-risk, although subclinical at this time.However, the results of the BASC-3 parent reports show significant concerns in areas related to anxietyand physical complaints (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, or general discomfort). Parents report that shehas to work hard to maintain her focus and has difficulty with transitions and when things don't go herway. She appears anxious, which manifests in physical symptoms. [NAME] is reported to be veryoverwhelmed by many types of sensory input. These findings suggest that [NAME] may be experiencinga high level of internal stress and emotional distress. It’s important to consider that children with anxietyoften report physical symptoms, which may occur in situations they find stressful. It is believed that[NAME]ysical complaints are related to emotional issues, such as anxiety. In children, frequentreports of headaches and stomachaches can sometimes indicate anxiety or other emotional difficulties.Additionally, the results indicate that [NAME] has some behavioral difficulties, particularly in the area ofhyperactivity. This means she may struggle with sitting still or staying focused, which could be related toissues like ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder). Sometimes, children act out because theyare feeling emotionally overwhelmed, or their behavior may lead to feelings of anxiety or low[NAME] McWhorterDOB: 12/21/2016-5-

self-esteem. It is recommended that parents share their concerns with their pediatrician in order to rule-outthe presence of ADHD.[NAME]fficulty with social interactions is also worth noting, as the results show she may bewithdrawn and have trouble with social skills. This could be due to emotional reasons, such as anxiety.She would benefit from continued work with her school-based social worker on understanding thelanguage of feelings, physical indicators of anxiety, and support for building friendship skills.Academic AssessmentAccuracy in Reading including Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Memory, and Decoding[NAME] was administered the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing, Second Edition(CTOPP-2). Phonological processing is understood to include phonological awareness, phonologicalmemory, and rapid naming. Phonological awareness refers to an individual’s awareness of and access tothe sound structure of oral language, while phonological memory is understood as the coding ofphonological information for temporary storage in working or short-term memory. Rapid naming, anadditional form of phonological processing, requires efficient retrieval of phonological information fromlong-term or permanent memory and will be further discussed in the section regarding reading retrievaland naming speed.[NAME]erall phonological awareness fell within the average range. The Elision subtest of theCTOPP-2 measures the extent to which an examinee is able to repeat a word said by the examiner beforeproducing the word again with the removal of target sounds, which revealed average skills. Herperformance on phoneme isolation tasks also fell within the average range. Similarly, [NAME]demonstrated average performance on the Blending Words subtest of the CTOPP-2, which measures anindividual’s ability to combine sounds in order to produce words.[NAME]onological memory was considered to be exceptionally strong. She presented with a strongperformance regarding her Memory for Digits, which considers the extent to which an individual canrepeat a series of numbers spanning in length from two to eight digits. Her performance fell significantlyabove the average range on the Nonword Repetition subtest of the CTOPP, which measures an examinee’sability to repeat nonwords that range in length from three to fifteen sounds.[NAME] was also administered additional subtests to assess single word decoding and sight wordreading, as measured by the WIAT-4. Her performance fell at the 18th percentile on the Word Readingassessment, where [NAME] was asked to read through a list of words as accurately as possible. However,she scored within the 45th percentile on the Pseudoword Decoding task, which is considered average. Shepresented with stronger phonics development as compared to her orthographic mapping of sight words.Reading Retrieval and Naming SpeedRapid naming skills were assessed using the Rapid Digit Naming and Rapid Letter Naming subtests fromthe CTOPP-2, which measures the rate at which [NAME] quickly recalled familiar and presumably roteinformation. Her performance revealed below average naming speed at the 12th percentile.[NAME] was also administered the Test of Word Reading Efficiency, assessing both word reading anddecoding retrieval speed. [NAME]rformance on sight word reading efficiency, which requires thestudent to read as many real, printed words as she can within 45 seconds, revealed below averageperformance at the 16th percentile. The Phonemic Decoding Efficiency subtest required [NAME] to readas many pronounceable printed nonwords as she could within 45 seconds. The assessment begins with[NAME] McWhorterDOB: 12/21/2016-6-

two-letter nonwords and builds. Her performance on this assessment fell within the below average rangeat the 19th percentile.Connected Text Reading Ability and ComprehensionOral reading fluency was assessed using the GORT-5, measuring oral reading rate, accuracy, andcomprehension when engaged in connected texts, where sentences within single passages relate to eachother. [NAME]erall performance fell at the 10th percentile, which was considered below average.Weaknesses in both her accuracy and rate of reading were observed, which then impacted hercomprehension of text. Additional reading comprehension measures utilized by the WIAT-4 suggestedthat when there are reduced demands for fluency in place, [NAME]mprehension of text is intact.MathThe Mathematics Composite from the WIAT-4 is composed of two subtests; Numerical Operations andMath Problem Solving. [NAME]rformance fell within the average range on the NumericalOperations task, which assessed her ability to solve grade-level untimed written math problems. On theMath Problem Solving subtest, [NAME] was asked to solve untimed math word problems related to basicskills (i.e. counting, clock reading, etc.), everyday applications (time, money, word problems), geometry,and algebra. Her performance on this activity again fell within the average range. Timed mathassessments revealed significant challenges with her retrieval speed and are representative of the thread ofdysfluency that impacts [NAME]arning profile. Her performance fell at the 2nd percentile.WritingThe Written Expression composite from the WIAT-4 measures a student’s spelling and sentence writingabilities. Sentence Writing tasks on the WIAT-4 revealed age/grade appropriate knowledge of spellingrules when required to spell in isolation. Additionally, [NAME] performed best when asked to combinesentences. This skill is important because it measures a student’s understanding of grammar, sentencestructure, and word relationships. Sentence Combining assists students in expressing ideas more clearlyand in a more detailed manner, making their writing more engaging and cohesive.However, some difficulty was observed on sentence building tasks where there was no inherent structureto the activity. Despite having knowledge of correct sentence formulation, [NAME] struggled to think ofsentences around specific vocabulary words and without models and examples. Her spelling also suffered.This was again observed on the KTEA-3 written expression task. While her overall performance fellwithin the average range, [NAME] had difficulty generating thoughts and ideas in writing, especiallywhen she was not provided sentence starters or sentence frames.Listening ComprehensionIn this subtest, [NAME] was asked to listen to sentences or passages, and then respond to comprehensionquestions. It is a measure of her reasoning ability while removing the demands of reading. [NAME]formance fell within the upper end of the average range.Oral Expression[NAME]rformance on tasks assessing her oral language fluency, sentence repetition, and oralexpression were considered to fall within the average range for her age. However, a slight discrepancywas notable on tasks of expressive vocabulary, despite her intact performance on speech and languagescreeners. [NAME] would likely benefit from word work within the context of her reading routine.[NAME] McWhorterDOB: 12/21/2016-7-

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS[NAME] is a bright, imaginative second-grader with strengths in creative thinking, visual-spatialreasoning, and building meaningful relationships with her peers. Her cognitive profile revealshigh-average general intellectual abilities, with notable strengths in nonverbal reasoning, visual-motorintegration, and working memory. [NAME] excels in tasks that require fluid reasoning and visual-spatialproblem-solving, as demonstrated by her high scores on the [ADDRESS]V in these areas. Fluid reasoningenables students to think logically and grasp abstract concepts, such as math and science principles, evenwhen they encounter them for the first time. This skill helps children recognize patterns and relationships,which are crucial for problem-solving. Visual-spatial processing, which involves interpreting andmanipulating visual information, helps students understand how objects relate to each other in space,making it easier to interpret diagrams, maps, and other visual representations. It also aids in organizingwriting by helping students visualize the structure of their work, leading to more coherent output. Theseskills are particularly valuable in subjects that require spatial reasoning, such as geometry and art, andthey enhance reading comprehension by enabling students to visualize scenes and concepts. Together,strong fluid reasoning and visual-spatial processing equip children to navigate complex problems,recognize patterns, and understand visual materials, contributing to overall academic achievement acrossmultiple areas. [NAME] is also considered to be a hard-working and motivated learner who is deeplyinvested in her academic success.However, [NAME]aluation indicates specific challenges, particularly in areas related to readingfluency and retrieval speed, which are consistent with characteristics of dyslexia. Her performance onassessments such as the CTOPP-2, TOWRE-2, and GORT-5 highlights below-average naming speed,word reading efficiency, and connected text fluency, indicating that she struggles with the rapid retrievalof verbal information and fluent reading. While she has intact phonological awareness and anexceptionally strong phonological memory, her challenges with reading lie more in the retrieval of learnedinformation rather than in understanding phonological concepts, which is the skill of rapid naming.Rapid naming, in the context of reading and language development, refers to a child's ability to quicklyand accurately name objects, colors, letters, or numbers when they see them. This skill is importantbecause it plays a significant role in a child's ability to read effectively. Intact rapid naming performanceis like having a strong foundation of word recognition. If [NAME] can quickly name the words, itbecomes easier for her to understand what she’s reading. When children can quickly and accuratelyidentify and name words and letter patterns, it paves the way for them to become more confident andskilled readers. Given its continued impact on her reading, [NAME] requires interventions to targetautomaticity in all aspects of word knowledge, including the sound structure of words, recognition ofcommon letter patterns, development of vocabulary knowledge, practice with parts of speech, discussionof roots and suffixes, and finally, the connection of all these skills to passage reading.[NAME] also faces challenges with verbal memory, as evidenced by her below-average performance onthe long-delay free recall task of the CVLT-C. These difficulties suggest that [NAME] struggles withencoding and retrieving verbal information efficiently, particularly when the task requires organizinginformation into meaningful categories. This challenge may impact her ability to recall language conceptsquickly during classroom activities.This profile is often seen in students with retrieval deficit dyslexia. [STUDENT_NAME] may find it difficult to gether thoughts onto paper, even after she’s come up with an idea for a sentence. The process of pullingwords from memory to write can be particularly challenging. Consistent use of strategies, such as writinga dash for each word, visualizing their ideas, or acting out what they want to say, can help these studentsretrieve their thoughts more effectively. By doing this, teachers can tap into [TEACHER_NAME]ME]’s strengths in[TEACHER_NAME] McWhorterDOB: 12/21/2016-8-

problem solving and visual-spatial reasoning. Additionally, graphic organizers are especially importantfor students with retrieval difficulties because they provide a clear structure for organizing informationand understanding how different ideas connect. Using a variety of graphic organizers, each showingdifferent relationships between concepts, can help make the writing process smoother and lessoverwhelming.Her processing speed is another area of concern, with her scores falling within the low-average range.This may affect her ability to quickly process and respond to academic tasks, particularly those thatinvolve reading and math retrieval. Despite these challenges, [NAME]mprehension remains intactwhen fluency demands are reduced, demonstrating her ability to understand material when given adequatetime and support. [TEACHER_NAME]ME]’s teachers should give her plenty of opportunities to practice and review whatshe’s learned and support concepts taught within reading intervention amid the context of the fullclassroom.Socially and emotionally, [NAME] is a kind and inclusive child, though she experiences some internaldistress, as shown by physical symptoms like headaches and stomachaches, which are likely tied tounderlying anxiety. These somatic complaints, along with her parents' concerns about attention regulationand sensory sensitivities, suggest that [NAME] may experience heightened stress in response toenvironmental factors such as noise and transitions. Despite this, she demonstrates good emotionalregulation in structured settings, particularly in school, where her teacher reports no clinically significantconcerns regarding anxiety or attention. [NAME] likely requires continued support from the school-basedsocial worker to support her emotional development. At this time, any perceived challenges with attentionare likely attributed to her anxiety although parents are encouraged to share the results of this evaluationwith [NAME]diatrician in order to rule out a diagnosis of ADHD.Given her profile of strengths and weaknesses, [NAME] likely meets the criteria for special educationservices under the [ADDRESS] special education disability category of Specific Learning Disability(SLD) in reading, with a primary focus on dyslexia. Her difficulties with rapid retrieval, reading fluency,and verbal memory are indicative of a reading disability that impacts her ability to perform at grade levelwithout specialized intervention. Based on the data obtained from this evaluation, the followingrecommendations are offered for consideration:Disability categories to consider as part of the MA Special Education Disability Frameworks:●This report shall not be considered the sole data point for making disability determinations.Recommendations and strategies contained within this report are offered for consideration of theteam.●Determination of disability categories should be considered and agreed upon as an IEP team,including parents.
