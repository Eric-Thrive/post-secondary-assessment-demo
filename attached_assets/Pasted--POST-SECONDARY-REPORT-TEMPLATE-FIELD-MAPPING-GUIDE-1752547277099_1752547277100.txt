POST-SECONDARY REPORT TEMPLATE FIELD MAPPING GUIDE
===========================================

This template uses the following field mappings from the database:

BASIC PLACEHOLDERS (replaced with simple values):
[Date] → Current date (auto-generated)
[Grade] → assessment_cases.grade_band (if applicable)
[Total Count] → count of all items in item_master_data

DYNAMIC CONTENT PLACEHOLDERS (replaced with generated sections):
[For each functional barrier identified...] → Generates a section for each barrier/accommodation pair

POST-SECONDARY ITEM MASTER FIELD MAPPINGS (for each item):
- canonical_id → Internal identifier (e.g., "sustained_attention_limit")
- barrier_label → Section heading (e.g., "Sustained Attention Limitation")
- barrier_description → Detailed description of functional impact
- accommodation_title → Accommodation name
- accommodation_description → Detailed accommodation description
- academic_domain → Academic area affected
- implementation_notes → How to implement the accommodation
- effectiveness_metrics → How to measure success

CONDITIONAL FORMATTING:
- Items are sorted by academic domain
- Accommodations are grouped by barrier type
- Implementation notes are included when available

# Disability Accommodation Report

**Analysis Date:** [Date]  
**Analysis Focus:** Post-Secondary Educational Accommodations

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This comprehensive assessment analysis identifies functional barriers impacting academic performance and maps evidence-based accommodations to support student success in post-secondary education. Each accommodation is directly linked to identified functional impacts with implementation guidance.

**Analysis Overview:**
- Total functional barriers identified: [Total Count]
- Academic domains affected: [List of domains]
- Evidence-based accommodations provided: [Accommodation count]

---

## 2. Functional Impact Summary

### Identified Functional Barriers

[For each functional barrier identified, the following format will be populated:]

#### [barrier_label from item_master]

**Functional Impact:** [barrier_description from item_master]

**Evidence Basis:** [evidence_description from item_master]

**Academic Domain Affected:** [academic_domain from item_master]

---

## 3. Accommodation & Support Plan

### Required Academic Accommodations

[For each accommodation mapped to barriers:]

#### [accommodation_title from item_master]

**Rationale:** Addresses [barrier_label from item_master]

**Description:** [accommodation_description from item_master]

**Implementation:** [implementation_notes from item_master]

**Effectiveness Metrics:** [effectiveness_metrics from item_master]

## Field Mapping Reference

For administrators and developers, here's how data flows from the assessment to this report:

| Report Section | Database Field | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Barrier Label | item_master.barrier_label | e.g., "Sustained Attention Limitation" |
| Functional Impact | item_master.barrier_description | Clinical description |
| Evidence | item_master.evidence_description | Assessment citations |
| Accommodation Title | item_master.accommodation_title | e.g., "Extended Time" |
| Accommodation Description | item_master.accommodation_description | Detailed explanation |
| Implementation | item_master.implementation_notes | How to apply |
| Metrics | item_master.effectiveness_metrics | Success measures |
| Academic Domain | item_master.academic_domain | Area of study affected |

---

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### For Disability Services
- Review all accommodations for institutional policy compliance
- Schedule regular check-ins to assess accommodation effectiveness
- Coordinate with faculty for seamless implementation

### For Faculty
- Implement accommodations as specified
- Maintain confidentiality regarding student disabilities
- Contact disability services with questions or concerns

### For Students
- Present accommodation letter to instructors at the beginning of each term
- Communicate proactively about accommodation needs
- Report any implementation issues to disability services

---

## 5. Quality Assurance

**Data Sources:**
- Clinical assessment data
- Educational history
- Functional impact analysis
- Evidence-based accommodation mapping

**Confidence Level:** High - All accommodations are directly linked to identified functional barriers with supporting evidence.
