About Sarah
Sarah is a bright, thoughtful student who thrives with small changes to her instruction and a supportive environment. She’s kind, engaged, and eager to succeed.
Her biggest challenges are anxiety, reading, and processing speed, which can make it difficult for her to complete assignments. She has really benefited from accommodations and interventions around anxiety and reading instruction.
Sarah might appear comfortable, but she often looks to others to figure out what to do, which can hide how much support she really needs. With small adaptations, she can shine.
Key Support Strategies
Use her strengths: oral language, kindness, collaboration, and conceptual understanding.
Support her challenges: anxiety, processing speed, transitions, and decoding/fluency.
Small changes go far: shorter tasks, verbal guidance, prep time, and patience make a big difference.
Don’t underestimate her: If Sarah seems to struggle, it doesn’t mean she doesn’t understand—she may just need a little more time to show what she knows.
