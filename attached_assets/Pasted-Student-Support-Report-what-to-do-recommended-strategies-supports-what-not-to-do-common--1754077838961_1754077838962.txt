Student Support Report
✔ = what to do (recommended strategies/supports)
 ✘ = what not to do (common mistakes/counterproductive actions)
 Use plain, observable language—no medical or diagnostic terms.

Student Overview
[Brief summary: student’s name or initials, grade, general background, relevant context. Include family input or student voice if available.]

Key Support Strategies
Use strengths: [List key student strengths—e.g., oral language, kindness, collaboration, conceptual understanding.]


Support challenges: [List key areas of need—e.g., anxiety, processing speed, transitions, decoding/fluency.]


Small changes go far: [E.g., shorter tasks, verbal guidance, prep time, patience.]


Don’t underestimate the student: If the student seems to struggle, it doesn’t mean they don’t understand— they may just need a little more time to show what they know.
