Yes, caching issues are a fairly common problem when working with Supabase, especially depending on which parts of the stack you’re interacting with. Here’s a breakdown of where caching may cause trouble and what you can do about it:

🔁 Common Supabase Caching Scenarios

1. Supabase Storage / CDN

Supabase serves files from its storage buckets through a CDN (like Cloudflare), which aggressively caches content to improve performance.
	•	Problem: When you upload a new version of a file (e.g., replacing an image), you might still see the old version due to CDN caching.
	•	Solution:
	•	Add a cache-busting query string when fetching files, like ?t=${Date.now()} or a version number.
	•	Use Supabase’s publicUrl with a unique identifier for each version.
	•	You can also disable caching with HTTP headers if you’re using a custom server, but this isn’t directly configurable in Supabase’s built-in storage URL.

2. Supabase Realtime or Database Caching
	•	Supabase Realtime doesn’t cache, but if you’re using a frontend framework or state management library, your UI might appear “stale” if updates don’t re-fetch data properly.
	•	If you’re using PostgREST (via the supabase.from(...).select() API), Supabase doesn’t cache results, but your browser or frontend library might.
	•	Solution:
	•	Ensure you invalidate or refetch queries after inserts/updates/deletes.
	•	If using React, consider using react-query, SWR, or Supabase’s own client to manage cache invalidation logic.

3. API Gateway / Edge Function Caching
	•	If you’re using Supabase Edge Functions (built on Deno), you might hit caching at the Cloudflare or browser level.
	•	Solution:
	•	Set explicit headers like Cache-Control: no-store or no-cache in your function responses.
	•	Supabase doesn’t cache Edge Function responses by default, but client-side fetch logic might.

✅ Best Practices to Avoid Caching Issues
	•	Always invalidate or refetch data after mutating operations.
	•	Use versioned URLs or timestamps to bust file caches.
	•	Make sure your frontend isn’t holding onto stale data (e.g. React state, localStorage, etc.).
	•	If using a service worker or PWA, verify that old cache isn’t interfering.
	•	When possible, use Supabase’s onSnapshot() or subscription methods to reflect realtime updates.
