# K-12 Educational Assessment Analysis Report

## Student Support Report

### Student Overview

Charlotte is a creative, friendly, and motivated 2nd grader at Brackett Elementary. She enjoys building projects, working with others, and values her friendships. Charlotte works hard and shows strong problem-solving skills, but she struggles with reading fluency, retrieving words quickly, and sometimes feels anxious, especially with new situations or sensory overload. Her teachers see her as well-regulated at school, while her parents notice more anxiety and sensory sensitivities at home. Charlotte benefits from targeted classroom strategies for reading and processing speed, and she does best when her strengths are used to support her learning.

### Key Support Strategies

Use strengths: Visual-spatial reasoning, creative thinking, strong peer relationships.

Support challenges: Reading fluency, slow retrieval of words/information, anxiety and sensory sensitivities.

Small changes go far: Give extra time, break tasks into steps, use visuals and sentence starters, and check in regularly.

Don't underestimate the student: If Charlotte seems stuck or slow, she likely understands but needs more time or a different way to show what she knows.
