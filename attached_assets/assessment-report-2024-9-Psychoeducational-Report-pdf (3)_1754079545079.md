Student Support Report

Student Overview  
Charlotte McWhorter is a creative, hard-working 2nd grader at Brackett Elementary who enjoys building projects and values her friendships. She is motivated to do well in school and is described as kind, inclusive, and emotionally well-regulated in class. Charlotte’s main strengths are in visual-spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and working memory, but she struggles with reading fluency, rapid retrieval of information, and sometimes feels anxious or overwhelmed, especially in new or noisy situations. Her parents note worries about her attention, sensory sensitivities, and anxiety, though teachers see her as focused and well-behaved at school. Charlotte benefits from targeted classroom strategies for reading and processing speed, plus ongoing support for emotional well-being.

Key Support Strategies

- Use strengths: Visual-spatial reasoning, creative problem-solving, strong working memory, kindness, and motivation.
- Support challenges: Reading fluency, rapid retrieval (naming speed), verbal memory, processing speed, and occasional anxiety/sensory overwhelm.
- Small changes go far: Give extra time, break tasks into steps, use visuals and organizers, offer sentence starters, and check in regularly.
- Don’t underestimate the student: If Charlotte seems slow to respond or struggles with reading, it’s not a lack of understanding—she just needs more time and support to show what she knows.

Strengths

Visual-Spatial Reasoning  
What You See:  
Charlotte quickly understands diagrams, patterns, and visual instructions; she enjoys building and hands-on projects.  
What to Do:  
✔ Use graphic organizers, visual models, and hands-on activities to teach new concepts.  
✘ Don’t rely only on verbal explanations or expect her to learn best through listening alone.

Creative Problem-Solving  
What You See:  
She comes up with unique ideas, enjoys open-ended tasks, and likes to figure out how things work.  
What to Do:  
✔ Offer opportunities for creative projects, building, or designing solutions to problems.  
✘ Don’t limit her to rote tasks or worksheets without room for creativity.

Kindness and Collaboration  
What You See:  
Charlotte is inclusive, encourages peers, and works well in groups.  
What to Do:  
✔ Pair her with classmates for collaborative work and peer learning.  
✘ Don’t isolate her or overlook her as a resource for group activities.

Challenges / Areas of Need

Reading Fluency and Retrieval Speed  
What You See:  
Charlotte reads slowly, hesitates with word recognition, and struggles to quickly name letters or words; she may lose her place or need extra time.  
Evidence:  
Below-average scores on reading fluency and rapid naming tasks; teacher notes slow reading and need for repetition.  
Impact on Learning:  
She falls behind on grade-level reading tasks and may get frustrated or tired during long reading assignments.  
What to Do:  
✔ Give extra time for reading and written work; break reading into smaller chunks.  
✔ Use repeated reading, sentence starters, and visual supports; allow oral responses when possible.  
What to Avoid:  
✘ Don’t rush her or penalize for slow reading.  
✘ Don’t assume she isn’t trying or doesn’t understand if she reads slowly.

Verbal Memory and Idea Retrieval  
What You See:  
She has trouble recalling words or ideas on demand, especially when writing or answering questions without prompts.  
Evidence:  
Difficulty with long-delay recall and generating sentences without support; needs help organizing thoughts.  
Impact on Learning:  
Writing assignments and oral responses can be slow or incomplete unless scaffolded.  
What to Do:  
✔ Provide graphic organizers, brainstorming time, and sentence frames; allow her to talk through ideas first.  
✔ Offer checklists and visual cues for multi-step tasks.  
What to Avoid:  
✘ Don’t expect her to generate ideas or sentences “on the spot” without support.  
✘ Don’t mark down for incomplete writing if scaffolds aren’t in place.

Processing Speed and Sensory/Emotional Needs  
What You See:  
Charlotte may take longer to start or finish tasks, especially under time pressure; she can become overwhelmed by noise, transitions, or unfamiliar situations.  
Evidence:  
Low-average processing speed scores; parent reports of sensory sensitivities and anxiety; physical complaints like headaches or stomachaches.  
Impact on Learning:  
She may freeze, withdraw, or show physical symptoms when stressed, and may need more time for transitions or new activities.  
What to Do:  
✔ Allow flexible timing, reduce task length, and give advance notice for changes; use calm, predictable routines.  
✔ Offer quiet breaks or a calm-down space if needed.  
What to Avoid:  
✘ Don’t surprise her with sudden changes or rush transitions.  
✘ Don’t ignore physical complaints or signs of overwhelm.

Additional Notes  
Charlotte’s comprehension and reasoning are strong when fluency demands are reduced. She thrives with structure, encouragement, and opportunities to use her visual and creative strengths. Regular check-ins and gentle emotional support help her feel safe and confident.
