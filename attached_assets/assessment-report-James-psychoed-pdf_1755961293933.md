## Student Overview

James is a 6th grader who is friendly, creative, and works hard, but gets easily distracted and sometimes feels overwhelmed or tired in class. He enjoys history, science, art, and spending time with friends, and says he puts in a lot of effort at school. Both his teacher and parents describe him as empathetic and kind, but note that he struggles to stay focused, especially on tasks he finds hard or uninteresting. James sometimes feels anxious or frustrated, and he benefits from encouragement and clear, step-by-step support. He likes school overall and feels comfortable asking for help when needed.

## Key Support Strategies

**Use strengths:** Creative problem-solving, empathy/kindness, visual-spatial thinking.

**Support challenges:** Attention/focus, processing speed, frustration/anxiety.

**Small changes go far:** Break tasks into steps, give extra time, check in often.

**Don't underestimate the student:** If James seems lost or tired, he may just need more time or a different approach—he understands more than he shows at first.
