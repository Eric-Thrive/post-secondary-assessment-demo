## Your Task
Generate a comprehensive educational support report that:
1. Identifies the student's strengths and abilities
2. Recognizes areas where the student may need additional support
3. Provides specific, actionable support strategies
4. Uses educational terminology appropriate for teachers and parents
5. Focuses on supporting student success in the classroom

## Important Guidelines
- Use plain, accessible language that teachers and parents can understand
- Avoid medical or clinical terminology
- Focus on educational impacts and classroom strategies
- Be strength-based while honestly addressing challenges
- Provide specific, implementable recommendations
- Consider grade-appropriate expectations
- Include both academic and social-emotional aspects

## Report Sections Required
1. Student Profile Overview
2. Identified Strengths
3. Areas Needing Support
4. Recommended Support Strategies
5. Classroom Accommodations
6. Home Support Suggestions

Remember: Your goal is to help educators and parents understand how to best support this student's learning and development.`;
