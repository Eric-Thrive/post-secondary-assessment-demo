Manual GitHub Repository Setup Instructions
==========================================

Since Replit has Git protection mechanisms, you'll need to run these commands manually:

1. First, check current status:
   git status

2. Stage all files:
   git add .

3. Commit with a comprehensive message:
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Replit Accommodation Engine

- AI-powered educational accessibility platform
- K-12 and post-secondary assessment analysis
- Advanced OpenAI integration with function calling
- Cascade inference system for comprehensive content generation
- Database-driven template flexibility
- Complete documentation and setup guide"

4. Change the remote URL to point to your new repository:
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Eric-Thrive/replit-accommodation-engine.git

5. Push to your new repository:
   git push origin development:main

Alternative approach if the above doesn't work:
- Use git remote remove origin
- Then git remote add origin https://github.com/Eric-Thrive/replit-accommodation-engine.git
- Then git push origin development:main

Your new repository will be available at:
https://github.com/Eric-Thrive/replit-accommodation-engine
