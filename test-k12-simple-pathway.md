# K-12 Demo Simple Pathway Test

## What Changed
1. Updated `NewK12Assessment.tsx` to call `/api/analyze-assessment` (simple pathway)
2. Simple pathway already supports K-12 demo via environment detection
3. Disabled post-secondary template validation for K-12 reports

## How It Works Now
1. K-12 assessment uploads documents
2. Extracts text from PDFs
3. Calls `/api/analyze-assessment` with:
   - moduleType: 'k12'
   - environment: 'k12-demo' (from localStorage)
   - documents: extracted text
   - studentGrade: selected grade

4. Server detects K-12 demo environment and:
   - Loads `markdown_report_template_k12_demo` template
   - Sends template + documents to AI
   - AI generates complete markdown report

## Expected Result
- AI receives the K-12 demo template with placeholders
- AI fills in actual student data from uploaded documents
- Returns complete "Student Support Report" with:
  - Student name, grade from document
  - Strengths identified
  - Areas needing support
  - Specific strategies and accommodations
  - Parent-friendly language

## No Item Master Tables
- Simple pathway doesn't use item master tables
- Direct markdown generation like post-secondary demo
- Template sent to AI for completion
