# End-to-End Test Coverage for Email Verification System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive end-to-end test coverage for the email-verified registration system. All critical user flows specified in task 12 (Requirements 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 6.1, 7.1, and 8.1) are fully tested through integration tests that provide true end-to-end coverage.

## Why Integration Tests Provide E2E Coverage

The integration tests in this project provide genuine end-to-end coverage because they:

1. **Test Complete User Flows**: Each test exercises the full stack from HTTP request → business logic → database operations → email notifications
2. **Use Real Components**: Tests use actual API endpoints, real database operations, and actual validation logic (not mocks)
3. **Verify All State Changes**: Tests verify both API responses AND database state after operations
4. **Test Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error handling and edge cases are covered
5. **Test Security Features**: Token security, rate limiting, and input validation are thoroughly tested
