### Desktop Browsers (Recommended)

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)

## Test Implementation Details

### Test File Location

`tests/e2e/k12-responsive.spec.ts`

### Key Test Functions

1. **checkNoHorizontalScroll(page)**: Verifies document width doesn't exceed viewport
2. **Viewport Configuration**: Tests use exact breakpoint widths specified in requirements
3. **Element Verification**: Tests check for card overflow, text readability, and styling

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all responsive tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/k12-responsive.spec.ts

# Run on specific browser
npx playwright test tests/e2e/k12-responsive.spec.ts --project=chromium

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test tests/e2e/k12-responsive.spec.ts --ui

# Generate HTML report
npx playwright test tests/e2e/k12-responsive.spec.ts --reporter=html
```

## Issues Found

None. All tests passed successfully.

## Recommendations

1. **Install Additional Browsers**: Run `npx playwright install` to test on Firefox, WebKit, and mobile browsers
2. **Manual Device Testing**: Test on actual mobile and tablet devices to verify touch interactions
3. **Performance Testing**: Consider adding performance metrics for responsive transitions
4. **Visual Regression**: Consider adding screenshot comparisons for each breakpoint
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility at all breakpoints

## Conclusion

✅ **Task 9.2 Complete**: All automated responsive tests pass successfully across the 5 required breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px, 1920px). The K-12 Report Viewer demonstrates proper responsive behavior with no horizontal scroll at any breakpoint, and all cards and accordions are readable and functional.

## Next Steps

1. Run tests on additional browsers (Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Perform manual testing on actual mobile and tablet devices
3. Document any device-specific issues discovered during manual testing
4. Update responsive design documentation with any findings
